# Safe And Effective
Aggregated data on Covid-19 and their "vaccines" that were created by companies such as: Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. 

1.) Pfizer Documents
  Released: July 1 2022
    The following link will download the Pfizer documents released on July 1 2022
      https://pdata0916.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pdocs/multiple/pd-production-070122.zip
    
This dataset contains many different things, most of which I have yet to sit down and fully read and retain. However, if you navigate to the dataset (folder titled pd-production-070122) and then open the file "125742_S2_M5_5354_wi235284-protocol.pdf" and then navigate to the end of page 9, you will see this excerpt:
  
  "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) noted that “potential risks of mRNA vaccines to the pregnant person and the fetus are unknown because these vaccines have not been studied in pregnant people.”
  
This is just one of the many concerning revelations of the Pfizer documents, this one being released on 4 days ago.

2.) Data Analysis - Population size, person(s) at least one dose vaccinated, cumulative deaths

So, why did I analyze these countries? Well, they all have different vaccination rates and handled the onset and spread of the virus in different ways

Here are the same countries with their respective one dose vaccination rates.

The trend is obvious but none of this data matters without relativity.

What about population size?

So, a simple question for you, why is Africa doing so good with Covid-19 while the West is seeing record numbers in hospitalizations, deaths, cases, etc?
