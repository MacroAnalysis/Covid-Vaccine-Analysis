# Safe And Effective
Aggregated data on Covid-19 and their "vaccines" that were created by companies such as: Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson and AstraZeneca. 

# 1.) Pfizer Documents
  Released: July 1 2022
    The following link will download the Pfizer documents released on July 1 2022
      https://pdata0916.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pdocs/multiple/pd-production-070122.zip
    
This dataset contains many different things, most of which I have yet to sit down and fully read and retain. However, if you navigate to the dataset (folder titled pd-production-070122) and then open the file "125742_S2_M5_5354_wi235284-protocol.pdf" and then navigate to the end of page 9, you will see this excerpt:

This is just one of the many concerning revelations of the Pfizer documents, this one being released on 4 days ago.

# 2.) Data Analysis - Population size, person(s) at least one dose vaccinated, cumulative deaths

> So, why did I analyze these countries? 
Well, they all have different vaccination rates and handled the onset and spread of the virus in different ways

![Covid - One Dose](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101907663/177395397-94e33976-5960-46a8-aec0-7f3c1bdf95b3.png)

Here are the same countries with their respective one dose vaccination rates.

The trend is obvious but none of this data matters without relativity.

> What about population size?

> So, why is Africa staying so resillient when compared to the West? Why are western countries with less populations than entire continents experiencing more deaths per million people?
